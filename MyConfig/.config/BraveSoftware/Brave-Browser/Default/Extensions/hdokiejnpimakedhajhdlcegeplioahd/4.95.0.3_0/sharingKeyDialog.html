  <p>In order to create a shared folder or for someone else to share a site or secure note with you, you must perform this step once.</p>
  <p class="dialogText">Generating sharing keys can take a long time (sometimes several minutes) when done via JavaScript, and your browser may become unresponsive during this process. Our Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome browser extensions automatically perform this step the first time you login, in a much faster manner.  If you have trouble with this method, we recommend using one of those extensions.  If you must use JavaScript to generate your sharing keys, we recommend Google Chrome, as its JavaScript engine is many times faster than any other browser.  Internet Explorer's JavaScript engine is many times slower than other browsers, so it's doubtful that it will work at all. If you experience slow script warnings during this process, be sure to choose to let the script continue to run.</p>
